# Minimal Hardware Setup for ESP8266
This guide explains the minimal required hardware setup to power up and properly boot the ESP8266. It ensures stable operation and avoids unexpected boot failures.

## 1. Required Components
To get the ESP8266 up and running, you need the following components:
- **ESP8266 Module** (e.g., ESP-12E, ESP-12F, ESP-01)
- **3.3V Power Supply** (capable of providing at least 500mA)
- **Capacitors**: 100µF + 100nF (for power stability)
- **Pull-up Resistors** (10kΩ) for EN, RST, GPIO0, and GPIO2
- **Pull-down Resistor** (10kΩ) for GPIO15
- **Momentary Push Button** (for RESET and BOOT mode)
- **USB-to-Serial Adapter** (for programming, e.g., CP2102, CH340)

## 2. Minimal Wiring Setup
### ESP8266 Power Connections
| Pin  | Connection  |
|------|------------|
| **VCC**  | 3.3V (⚠️ Do NOT use 5V, it will damage the ESP8266) |
| **GND**  | Ground |

### Boot & Reset Circuit
| Pin   | Connection  | Purpose  |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **EN (CH_PD)**  | 10kΩ Pull-up to 3.3V | Enable ESP8266 |
| **RST**         | 10kΩ Pull-up to 3.3V + Push Button to GND | Reset the ESP8266 |
| **GPIO0**       | 10kΩ Pull-up to 3.3V + Push Button to GND | Must be HIGH for normal boot, LOW for flashing |
| **GPIO2**       | 10kΩ Pull-up to 3.3V | Must be HIGH during boot |
| **GPIO15**      | 10kΩ Pull-down to GND | Must be LOW during boot |
| **GPIO16**      | Connect to RST | Wakes ESP8266 from Deep Sleep |

Important Notes:
- After entering **Deep Sleep Mode**, the ESP8266 can only wake up if **GPIO16** is connected to **RST**.
- If you are not using Deep Sleep, leave **GPIO16** unconnected.
- Do not use **GPIO16** as an input with an external pull-up/down resistor, as it may interfere with sleep/wake functionality.

### Programming & Communication
| Pin  | Connection |
|------|------------|
| **TXD (GPIO1)**   | Connect to RX of USB-to-Serial adapter |
| **RXD (GPIO3)**   | Connect to TX of USB-to-Serial adapter |
| **GND**           | Connect to GND of USB-to-Serial adapter |

## 3. Boot Modes
ESP8266 supports different boot modes based on GPIO states at startup:

| GPIO15 | GPIO0 | GPIO2 | Mode  |
|--------|-------|-------|--------------------|
| 0V     | 0V    | 3.3V  | Flash Mode (UART) |
| 0V     | 3.3V  | 3.3V  | Normal Boot (SPI Flash) |

- **Normal Boot Mode**: Runs user firmware from flash memory.
- **Flash Mode**: Used for uploading firmware via UART.

## 4. Power Considerations
- **Stable 3.3V Power Supply**: ESP8266 can draw up to **300-500mA** during Wi-Fi operations. A weak power source may cause resets.
- **Decoupling Capacitors**: Add **10µF + 0.1µF** are the **VCC** pin for noise filtering.

## 5. Common Issues & Fixes
| Issue                        | Cause                                    | Solution                                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ESP8266 keeps resetting      | Unstable power                           | Use a proper 3.3V regulator and capacitors          |
| ESP8266 does not boot        | GPIO0, GPIO2, or GPIO15 misconfigured    | Check pull-up and pull-down resistors               |
| Garbage data on Serial Monitor | Wrong baud rate                         | Set baud rate to **115200** or **74880**            |
| Cannot upload code           | GPIO0 not LOW during upload              | Hold GPIO0 LOW while resetting                      |
| WiFi connection issues       | Weak WiFi signal or incorrect credentials | Move closer to the router or check WiFi credentials  |
| Flashing errors              | Insufficient power or incorrect connections | Ensure stable power supply and correct wiring       |
| High power consumption       | Deep sleep mode not enabled              | Enable deep sleep mode to save power                |
| Overheating                  | Poor ventilation                         | Ensure proper ventilation and heat dissipation      |
| GPIO pins not working        | Incorrect pin mode configuration         | Set correct pin mode (INPUT/OUTPUT) in the code     |
| Connection drops             | Interference or power fluctuations       | Reduce interference sources and ensure stable power |

## 6. Minimal Schematic
Here is a simplified schematic for stable ESP8266 operation:

To flash firmware onto the ESP8266, you need to place it into programming mode. This requires setting the GPIO0 pin to LOW while resetting the module. Here is the step-by-step process:
- **Step 1**: Press and hold both buttons **P1 (RST)** and **P2 (GPIO 0)**.
- **Step 2**: While keeping **P1 (RST)** pressed, release **P2 (GPIO 0)**.
- **Step 3**: Finally, release **P1 (RST)**.
- **Step 4**: Upload the firmware.
- **Step 5**: After uploading, press **P1 (RST)** once more to restart the ESP8266 and run

    Start uploading the firmware                    :active,     upload, after p1, 3s
    Wait for the firmware upload to complete        :active,     wait,  after upload, 5s
